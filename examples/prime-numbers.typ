  A *prime number* is an integer divisible by exactly two integers: 1, and itself.

  We consider 1 not to be a prime number, as it is divisible only by one integer.

_Proof._

Suppose there are finitely many prime numbers.

Let's write $p_0, p_1, dots, p_(n-1)$ a list of all prime numbers. We define:

$
  P = product_(i=0)^(n-1)p_i, quad
  N = P + 1.
$

Let $p$ be a prime divisor of $N$. We claim that:

$
  forall i, p eq.not p_i
$

#up(<proof>)

Indeed,

$
  p "divides" N and p "divides" P arrow.r.double.long p "divides" 1
$

So $p$ is a prime that is not part of the $p_i$, a contradiction. #pause
*Therefore, there must exists infinitely many prime numbers.*
